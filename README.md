# inventory-management-systems-DBMS-PROJECT
Inventory management systems leverage Database Management Systems (DBMS) to efficiently track and manage stock levels, orders, and product details. By using MySQL as the database engine, these systems benefit from robust data handling and querying capabilities. NetBeans provides an integrated development environment (IDE) that facilitates the design and implementation of such systems, offering tools for coding in languages like Java and for connecting to the MySQL database. This combination of MySQL for data storage and NetBeans for application development ensures that inventory management systems are both scalable and reliable, streamlining operations and improving accuracy in inventory tracking.
